Identity, Authentication, Authorization & Accounting (AAA)
1) Identity — “Who is this?”

An identity is how a person, device, or service is named so we can tell it apart from others.<br>
**Examples:** a username, email address, UUID, IP or MAC address.

**Important:** identity alone is just a claim (“I am alice@example.loc”). It becomes trustworthy only after authentication proves it.
