### Authentication Methods

---

Authentication can be performed using different methods. As security requirements increase, relying on just one method is usually not enough.
So, systems often use multiple authentication factors together.<br>

Authentication methods generally rely on one or more of the following:
- Something the user knows (e.g., a password or PIN)
- Something the user has (e.g., a device or a security token)
- Something the user is (e.g., biometric data like a fingerprint)

### 1. Single-Factor Authentication (SFA)
This method uses only one element, usually a password or PIN.

**Example scenario:**
A user logs in with a username + password.

**Disadvantages:**
Weak passwords can be guessed.
If someone steals or guesses the password, they can access the system easily.
