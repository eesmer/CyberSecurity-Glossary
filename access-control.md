# Access Control
> This document explains the concept of access control within the context of information security and describes common models and practical implementations.

## Definition
Access control refers to the set of rules and mechanisms that determine **who can access which information systems, resources, or data, when, how, and to what extent**.
Its main goal is to ensure that only authorized users access defined resources and to prevent unauthorized access.

Access control directly supports the **confidentiality** principle of information security.
It is also critical for resource efficiency, monitoring, and accountability.

## Types of Access Control

Different organizational structures and needs lead to the use of various access control models.

### 1- DAC (Discretionary Access Control)

This is a user-based model. *The resource owner decides who is allowed access.*
It is flexible but lacks centralized management. Typically seen in small to medium environments.
