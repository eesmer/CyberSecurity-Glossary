## Definition

Access control refers to the set of rules and mechanisms that determine **who can access which information systems, resources, or data, when, how, and to what extent**.
Its main goal is to ensure that only authorized users access defined resources and to prevent unauthorized access.

Access control directly supports the **confidentiality** principle of information security.
It is also critical for resource efficiency, monitoring, and accountability.
