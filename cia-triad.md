# CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
> This document explains the three core principles of information security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

---

## Definition
The CIA Triad consists of three core principles that form the basis of all information security measures:
- **Confidentiality**
- **Integrity**
- **Availability**

Together, these principles ensure that information is protected from unauthorized access, remains accurate and trustworthy, and is accessible when needed.<br>
All security policies, systems, and controls—directly or indirectly—aim to uphold these three principles.
