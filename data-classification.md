### Definition
Data classification is the method of analyzing an organization's information assets and separating them based on risk levels and appropriate protection needs.<br>
It helps determine:
- the sensitivity of the data,
- legal obligations,
- value of the information,
- and associated risks

The goal is to apply suitable protection measures to every type of data.<br><br>
Data classification is not only a technical task. It also forms the **foundation of organizational security policies**.<br>

Through data classification, an organization determines:<br>
- **Who can access which data**
- **How and where it should be stored**
- **What kind of protection methods must apply**

These factors affect access, storage, transmission, and disposal procedures.
